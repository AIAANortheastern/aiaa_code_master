This is the main place where all AIAA code will be stored. It allows for easy sharing of common modules as we move closer to custom avionics. Check out the shared folders for common modules. If you want to make changes, it's best practice to copy the code to your project's folder, then make modificaitons from there. If the changes are useful to others, feel free to ~~re-upload back into the shared spaces.~~ issue a pull request to this repository.
Again, don't forget to pull changes when you start working, and push changes when you're done!
